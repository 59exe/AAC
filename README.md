# AAC
This is an autoclicker I made in my spare time. It provides about 70cps-ish on both clicks, and has always on top enabled.


**UPDATE NOTES:**
- Alpha v0.1: Project creation, addition of left click autoclick at 10 cps.
- Alpha v0.2: Fixed stop button not stopping autoclicker.
- Alpha v0.3: Updated icon to vaporwave AAC icon.
- Alpha v0.4: Changed name from Acid AutoClicker to AAC.
- Alpha v0.4.1: Fixed .exe file crashing on stop button click.
- Alpha v0.5: Added right-click autoclicker.
- Alpha v0.6: You can now autoclick both left and right button at the same time.
- Alpha v0.7: Added logo in middle of app.
- Alpha v0.8: Added description text.
- Alpha v0.9: Deleted a useless DLL file that actually did nothing.
- (Last Alpha) Alpha v1.0: Added test button for left-click testing.
- (First Beta) Beta v1.0: Added reset button to left click test section, and slightly changed logo to include blue dot after black AAC text.

**Currently Working On:**
- Adding right click test button. Which probably will not work since you have to left click to press a button. Update will come in some time.
- Might start working on other projects.
